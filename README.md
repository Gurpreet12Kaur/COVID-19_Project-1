# COVID-19_Project-1

For this Project we decided to do analysis on covid 19 during 2020 in the US.  During the beginning of the project we did really struggle picking a topic and then when we get the topic we did struggle to see how to analysis the data.
In the project we decided we should focus on US and we split it in 3 therefore Gurpreet had months 1-4, Bebik had months 4-8 and Ola had months 8-12. We decided to focus on 2020 as it was the start of the COVID 19  outbreak.
Overall we managed to finish the project, as a group we were happy with the finish but we all felt like if we had more we could have done better.
